### About myself:

Having started my career as a customer service manager in a local insurance company with minimum skills, I became profficient in working with corporate clients.

My keen interest in engineering led me to working as a stress engineer in the large center in my city, where I continued self-learning, making structural design.

I’m interested in Web Development because this occupation provides endless possibilities for professional growth,
besides there’s a huge amount of free high quality resources for self-education and a large community of developers.

I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.
